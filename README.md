## Project Overview

This JavaScript project involves analysing a financial dataset to calculate key financial metrics. The dataset is provided in the `starter/index.js` file. The primary objectives include:

1. **Total Months:** Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.
2. **Net Total:** Determine the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. **Average Change:** Calculate the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
   - Track the total change in Profit/Losses from month to month and find the average (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`).
4. **Greatest Increase in Profits:** Identify the date and amount for the greatest increase in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
5. **Greatest Decrease in Profits:** Identify the date and amount for the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
